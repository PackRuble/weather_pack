## üå¶ weather_pack
A quick way to try out your UI ready weather conditions.

---

**Why choose this library?**

**_basic:_**
1. üö≤ Easy to use - you only need the APIKEY.
2. üèù Built-in geocoding - search for locations by assumed names or by coordinates.
3. ü©∫ Various units of measurement - speed, temperature, pressure and cardinal points.
4. üå§ There are original weather icons.

<ol>
<li>üîÆ At least one release application is already based on this package. Therefore, there is an 
additional guarantee of security and timely updates of this package.</li>
<li>üîì There is a method for checking your api for correctness.</li>
<li>üß± It is very easy to customize data models. Create your own data models and take only what 
you need from the built-in ones.</li>
<li>üßæ The code is well documented and each class is labeled and decoded. There are unit tests 
for the main functions of the package.</li>
<li>ü¶∫ Safe unpacking of types. If the server stops outputting values - your weather model 
will have a null field and the application will not crash.</li>
<li>üîß This package has no unnecessary dependencies and contains minimal code. 
Also, all platforms are supported.</li>

## Installing

1. Add dependency to your `pubspec.yaml`:
   ```yaml
       dependencies:
          weather_pack: <latest_version>
    ```
2. Run the command: `flutter pub get`
3. Use in your code:
   ```dart
   import 'package:weather_pack/weather_pack.dart';
   ```

## Getting Started

The easiest way to get the current weather forecast

```dart
Future<void> main() async {
  const api = 'YOUR_APIKEY'; // TODO: change to your Openweathermap APIkey
  final wService = WeatherService(api);

  // get the current weather in Amsterdam
  final WeatherCurrent currently = await wService.currentWeatherByLocation(
      latitude: 52.374, longitude: 4.88969);
  
  print(currently);
}
```

You can also change the request language:

```dart
final lang = WeatherLanguage.arabic;

final wService = WeatherService(api, language: lang);
```

> You can use the `lang` parameter to get the output in your language.
> 
> Translation is applied for the `city name` and `description` fields.

## Usage weather service

Now there are two weather models - `WeatherCurrent` and `WeatherOneCall`.

`WeatherOneCall` includes:
1. `WeatherCurrent`
2. `List<WeatherHourly>`
3. `List<WeatherMinutely>`
4. `List<WeatherDaily>`
5. `List<WeatherAlert>`

#### How to use?
You can get the weather in the following way:

```dart
final WeatherCurrent current = await wService
    .currentWeatherByLocation(latitude: 52.374, longitude: 4.88969);

final WeatherOneCall onecall = await wService
    .oneCallWeatherByLocation(latitude: 52.374, longitude: 4.88969);
```

## Usage geocoding service
`GeocodingService` is a service for easy location search when working with geographical names
and coordinates. Supports both the direct and reverse methods:
- Direct geocoding converts the specified name of a location or zip/post code into
  the exact geographical coordinates;
- Reverse geocoding converts the geographical coordinates into the names of the nearby locations;

You can find out more at this link: [Geocoding API OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/api/geocoding-api)

#### How to use?

Create `GeocodingService` in the following way:
```dart
final String cityName = 'suggested location name';
final String apiKey = 'your api key for OWM';

final GeocodingService gService = await GeocodingService(apiKey);
```

To find using place names use direct geocoding:
```dart
final List<PlaceGeocode> places = gService.getLocationByCityName(cityName);
```

or use reverse geocoding
```dart
final List<PlaceGeocode> places = gService.getLocationByCoordinates(latitude: 52.374, longitude: 4.88969);
```

## Usage units measure
By default, all weather models, e.g. `WeatherCurrent`, have measurable values of type `double`.
To display the data in a convenient format, it is necessary use the conversion method `value`
or `valueToString`:
```dart
void worksTempUnits({
  double temp = 270.78, // ex. received from [WeatherCurrent.temp]
  int precision = 3,
  Temp unitsMeasure = Temp.celsius,
}) {
  // The default temperature is measured in Kelvin of the `double` type.
  // We need the temperature to be displayed in Celsius to 3 decimal places

  print(unitsMeasure.value(temp, precision)); // `-2.37` type `double`
  print(unitsMeasure.valueToString(temp, precision)); // `-2.370` type `String`

  // if precision is 0:
  print(unitsMeasure.value(temp, 0)); // `-2.0` type `double`
  print(unitsMeasure.valueToString(temp, 0)); // `-2` type `String`
}
```

_By and large, the `valueToString()` method is needed to display correctly in ui,
and the `value()` method is for accurate calculations._

There are several units of measurement:

| Units of measure | Class            | Supported units                     | Conversion |
|------------------|------------------|-------------------------------------|------------|
| Temperature      | `Temp`           | kelvin, celsius, fahrenheit         | +          |
| Speed            | `Speed`          | ms, mph, kph                        | +          |
| Pressure         | `Pressure`       | hectoPa, mbar, mmHg, kPa, atm, inHg | +          |
| Cardinal points  | `SideOfTheWorld` | n, ne, e, se, s, sw, w, nw          | +(another) |

**Tip**: The `SideOfTheWorld` enum contains a static method `fromDegrees()` for converting degrees
to cardinal directions.


## Usage weather icons

You can use weather icons provided by the OWM service. See more about [weather conditions](https://openweathermap.org/weather-conditions).

Icons are stored locally in this package at the path `assets/weather_icons/`. 
They are ordered according to [Declaring resolution-aware image assets](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/ui/assets-and-images#resolution-aware).
This reflects the following correspondences:

`100*100 - in default(implied resolution @1), 200x200 - @2, 300x300 - @3, 400x400 - @4`

with the preservation of image quality.

#### How to use?
Get the weather icon in a safe way:
```dart
Image getWeatherIcon(String weatherIcon) {
  return Image.asset(
    ImagePathWeather.getPathWeatherIcon(weatherIcon),
    filterQuality: FilterQuality.high, // optional
    package: ImagePathWeather.packageName,
  );
}
```

or to process it completely by hand:
```dart
Widget getWeatherIcon(WeatherCurrent weather) {
  return Image.asset(
    'assets/weather_icons/${weather.weatherIcon}.png', // icon path
    package: 'weather_pack', // name package
    filterQuality: FilterQuality.high, // optional
    errorBuilder: (c, e, s) => Text(e), // will return the widget in case of an error
  );
}
```

By and large, you can use the best quality regardless of platform resolution by specifying `@4` to path:
```dart
'assets/weather_icons/@4/$weatherIcon.png'
```

## API key testing
It is possible to test the API key. 
To do this, the `OWMApiTest` class has a method `isCorrectApiKey()`:
```dart
void worksTestedAPIkey({
  String testedAPIkey = 'Your_key',
}) async {

  // If the key is correct, it will return `true`
  final bool isCorrect = await OWMApiTest().isCorrectApiKey(testedAPIkey);
}
```

## Features in development
1. [ ] Getting weather by location name (built-in geocoding).
